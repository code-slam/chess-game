# Chess Game in JavaScript

A simple chess game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a functional chess game from scratch, with features like piece movement, rule enforcement, and an intuitive user interface.

## Features (Planned)
- A fully interactive chessboard
- Visual representation of pieces and moves
- Enforcement of chess rules (check, checkmate, stalemate, castling, etc.)
- Highlights for possible moves
- User vs. User gameplay
- Potential future enhancements: AI opponent and undo functionality
